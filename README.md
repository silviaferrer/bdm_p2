In this work we present a comprehensive approach to a second part of a Big Data Management
Backbone. The project starts with a given solution for a Persistent Landing Zone, and is going to
implement a Formatted Zone and an Exploitation Zone including the calculation of a set of KPI’s
and a predictive analysis and the visualization of our overall analysis.

The original code can be found in Github: https://github.com/silviaferrer/bdm_p2

This project has three executables. Use the following commands to run them:
- python main.py data-formatting
    Load data to the Formatted Zone and format it

- python main.py data-visualization
    Calculate KPIs and store them in the Exploitation Zone

- python main.py data-prediction
    Train a ML model and store it in the Exploitation Zone
